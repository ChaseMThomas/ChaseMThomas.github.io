	<h1>Hi there, I'm Chase Thomas!</h1>

	<p>I'm a QA Engineer at <a href="https://www.workday.com/" target="_blank">Workday</a> and an aspiring Web Developer. Right now I'm focussing on leveling up my skills in Python, Javascript, and React. I already have a Bachelor's in Journalism, but I'm also working towards a BS in Computer Science. I'm happy at Workday, but open to collaborating on side projects.</p>
