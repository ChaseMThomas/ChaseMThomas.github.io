        <p>This page represents my entry back into the world of developing after months of accomplishing little. I intended to make the perfect site for myself but could never get started. I needed to learn this or that language first. I started a project on one framework, only to abandon it for another, which would itself be abandoned. I can't do this to myself anymore. Progress is about incremental accomplishments that build up to something greater. I see now that perfectionism has made it impossible for me to accomplish anything at all. But no more of that. I'm creating this simple homepage with these imperfect words as a first step towards something better.</p>
